            What is a Nanodegree program? In this post, we’ll try to answer this question by looking at what it means to offer a skills-based approach. We’ll then highlight some important program details, including our hiring and curriculum partnerships. We’ll follow that by breaking down four key ways a Nanodegree program is uniquely valuable, and then presenting some use cases organized around experience levels. Finally, we’ll explore the distinction between tech skills, and being “in tech,” and show you why the skills you learn in a Nanodegree program are applicable across a wide array of exciting fields.
