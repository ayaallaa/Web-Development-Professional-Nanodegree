sequence of MRI consist of two parts: Preparation and Acquisition.
- The user allowed to choose a different option for each part. For preparation, he can choose from Inversion, T2prep and Tagging. And for acquisition, he can choose from GRE, SSFP, and SE.
- For whatever acquisition the user will choose, he can view the Ernst angle curve for the selected acquisition along with its parameters. This can simply be a button that when clicked, a a graph window would pop-up with the Ernst angle curve. The curve can be calculated using an equation in case of GRE or simulation in case of SSFP.
- For each selected preparation option, the GUI shows the relevant parameters for the user to be able to change it.
- The GUI allow the user to change the startup cycles.
